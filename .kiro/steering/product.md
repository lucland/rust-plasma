# Product Overview

## Plasma Furnace Simulator

A high-performance desktop simulation framework for analyzing thermal dynamics of materials subjected to high-energy plasma heating. The simulator addresses complex challenges in modeling transient heat transfer coupled with solid-liquid-vapor phase transitions.

### Core Purpose
- Simulate plasma-material interactions in cylindrical furnace geometries
- Model heat transfer with phase changes (melting, vaporization) using the enthalpy method
- Support research in metallurgy, advanced manufacturing, and high-temperature materials processing
- Provide accurate computational tools for waste incineration and materials synthesis research

### Key Capabilities
- Multi-torch plasma configurations with 3D positioning
- Temperature-dependent material properties
- Real-time 2D/3D heatmap visualization with playback controls
- Parametric studies and optimization workflows
- Data export in multiple formats (CSV, JSON, VTK)
- Plugin system for extending physics models
- Formula engine for custom material properties and boundary conditions

### Target Users
Researchers in materials science, thermodynamics, environmental engineering, and related fields who need computational tools for plasma processing analysis but may not be programmers themselves.

### Academic Context
This is a computational framework designed to support scientific research with emphasis on:
- Verifiable physical models with documented assumptions
- Validation against analytical solutions and experimental data
- Energy conservation through robust numerical methods
- Reproducible results with versioned physics models
