## Development Guidelines

### Implementation Order
1. **Core Foundation (Tasks 1-6)**: Establish simulation engine with basic functionality
2. **Visualization MVP (Tasks 7-8)**: Get immediate visual feedback working
3. **User Interface (Tasks 9-11)**: Complete basic user interaction
4. **Advanced Features (Tasks 12-15)**: Add formula engine and multi-zone support
5. **Enhancement (Tasks 16-18)**: Polish and prepare for future features

### Testing Approach
- Each task should result in immediately testable functionality
- Use basic heatmap visualization to verify simulation correctness
- Test parameter changes through UI and observe visual results
- Validate performance targets (30s for Fast mode, 15+ FPS visualization)

### Code Reuse Strategy
- Before implementing each task, check existing codebase for reusable components
- Leverage existing Rust ecosystem crates (ndarray, rayon, serde) rather than reimplementing
- Build on established patterns from previous tasks
- Document reusable components for future tasks

### Quality Assurance
- Each task should include basic error handling and user feedback
- Implement parameter validation and range checking as features are added
- Ensure graceful degradation when features fail or perform poorly
- Maintain consistent UI patterns and error message formatting

## Success Criteria
