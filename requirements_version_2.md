# Plasma Furnace Simulator â€” Requirements (Version 2)
*Version 2*

## Introduction

This document defines the requirements for transforming the existing Plasma Furnace Simulator codebase into a production-ready industrial tool for waste management operations. The primary client is a Brazilian company operating plasma furnaces for medical waste, biological residues, cemetery bones, and potentially radioactive waste from Petrobras oil extraction operations.

Requirements are prioritized into **CRITICAL MVP**, **IMPORTANT**, **FUTURE**, and **LONG-TERM** features.

## Priority Classification

- ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL: MVP**: Must be delivered first - core simulation and basic 3D visualization for immediate industrial use.
- ðŸŸ¡ **IMPORTANT**: Complete industrial features - needed for full operational capability.
- ðŸŸ¢ **FUTURE**: Advanced operational features - enhanced waste management capabilities.
- ðŸ”µ **LONG-TERM**: Industrial IoT integration - live furnace monitoring and control.

## Design Principles (All Phases)

1.  **Scientific Rigor**: Base all formulations on established academic sources (e.g., Incropera & DeWitt for heat transfer, Patankar for numerics) and validate against analytical cases and experimental data when available.
2.  **Extensibility**: Design with a first-class plugin API, a sandboxed Formula Engine (Rhai), and modular physics packages to facilitate future expansion.
3.  **Industrial Usability**: Ensure the application provides clear error messages, robust performance, a bilingual UI (EN/PT-BR), and exports to standard industrial and academic formats (CSV, JSON, VTK).
4.  **Safety & Security**: Implement sandboxed execution for formulas and plugins, require signed plugins for security, and establish read-only defaults for live plant connections to prevent accidental operations.

-   The system SHALL support role-based access control (e.g., Operator, Engineer, Admin) to gate access to sensitive features like live connectivity.
-   The system SHALL maintain an audit log for critical actions like changes to simulation settings and live connection events.

### Academic & Process Requirements
-   **Architecture Decision Records (ADR)**: Key design decisions, such as the choice of numerical methods (Enthalpy, Crank-Nicolson), must be documented to justify the architecture.
-   **Project Documentation**: The technical documentation must be kept current to allow new team members to onboard efficiently.

## Roadmap & Milestones

-   **MVP (ðŸ”´)**: Implement 2D axisymmetric heat diffusion with a Gaussian source model, basic 3D visualization, project saving, and CSV/JSON export.
-   **Release 1 (ðŸŸ¡)**: Implement Crank-Nicolson solver, Enthalpy Method for phase change, advanced visualization, formula-driven properties, and basic waste feed modeling. Add VTK export and automated validation reports.
-   **Release 2 (ðŸŸ¢)**: Develop the plasma-jet module, add 3D theta discretization, model basic emissions/filters, and implement energy-balance validation against plant data.
-   **Release 3 (ðŸ”µ)**: Implement live read-only connectivity, generate compliance reports, and enable role-based access control.

## Traceability to Code Structure

-   **`src/simulation/solver.rs`**: Will contain the Forward Euler (MVP) and Crank-Nicolson / SOR (Release 1) implementations.
-   **`src/simulation/physics.rs`**: Will house the heat PDE, source terms, and phase-change logic (Enthalpy Method).
-   **`src/formula/`**: Will contain the Rhai engine integration for custom user formulas.
-   **`src/plugins/`**: Will host the plugin API and loader. The future Plasma Jet module will be a plugin.
-   **`src-tauri/src/`**: Will manage UI parameter handling, run control, and live data connectors (long-term).

## Definition of "Done" (Per Phase)

-   **MVP**: All ðŸ”´ items are implemented, unit and integration tests are passing, performance targets are met, and a basic user manual is complete.
-   **IMPORTANT**: All ðŸŸ¡ items are implemented, the validation pack generates automated reports, and VTK exports are verified in external tools like ParaView.

## Risks & Mitigations

-   **Risk**: The complexity of the Plasma Jet CFD/MHD model could cause delays.
    -   **Mitigation**: Begin with simplified, reduced-order models. Develop the full CFD/MHD model as a plugin behind a feature flag so it doesn't block other progress.
-   **Risk**: Live data integration may be unreliable or introduce security vulnerabilities.
    -   **Mitigation**: Default to read-only connections. Implement rigorous testing in a sandboxed environment before connecting to a live plant. Gate all write-access with strict permissions.
